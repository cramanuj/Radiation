	Abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with highest loco-regional recurrence among breast cancer subtypes. Radiotherapy is indispensable for TNBC loco-regional control. However, intrinsic radiosensitivity differences exist in TNBC patients and RT is still prescribed mainly based on conventional clinicopathologic features of patients without considering the differences. The purpose of the present study is to develop and validate a TNBC radiosensitive gene signature (RSGS) and to guide therapeutic decisions. In this study, we compared transcriptome profiles of 12 locally recurrent TNBCs to 20 non-locally recurrent TNBCs treated with surgery radio-chemotherapy and developed a seven-gene RSGS and a simplified three-gene RSGS by using pathway analysis, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model and rank-based linear algorithm. They were validated by using transcriptome profiles of 166 TNBC patients. Two gene signatures specifically identified a radiosensitive population that had an improved recurrence-free survival in patients treated with surgery radio-chemotherapy (Radiosensitive patients vs radioresistant patients, for seven-gene RSGS: P = 0.024, HR = 0.35, 95 {\%}CI 0.14--0.87 and for three-gene RSGS: P = 0.035, HR = 0.38, 95 {\%}CI 0.15--0.94). In contrast, there was no significant difference in outcome between predicted radiosensitive and radioresistant patients that treated with other treatment modality. RSGSs provide a useful tool for identification of radiosensitive/radioresistant TNBC patients and they could lead to a better selection of patients for RT protocols.},

@article{TME,
	Abstract = {Radiotherapy plays a central part in curing cancer. For decades, most research on improving treatment outcomes has focused on modulating radiation-induced biological effects on cancer cells. Recently, we have better understood that components within the tumour microenvironment have pivotal roles in determining treatment outcomes. In this Review, we describe vascular, stromal and immunological changes that are induced in the tumour microenvironment by irradiation and discuss how these changes may promote radioresistance and tumour recurrence. We also highlight how this knowledge is guiding the development of new treatment paradigms in which biologically targeted agents will be combined with radiotherapy.},

@article{predixscan,
	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},
